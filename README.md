# Extra Lab W2D1: the memory budget solver

*Authored by Ahmed (TA), 2026-08-02. Integrated with a machine verifier 2026-08-07.*

Start:      Morning's "numbers on disk" lecture. No GPU needed -- this is pure
            arithmetic against real model architecture specs.
Objective:  Given a GPU memory budget, a concurrent-user count, and a context
            length, compute -- from architecture fields alone, never from a
            model's marketing name -- the single largest model+precision
            combination that actually fits.

Time: about 90 minutes. This is a standalone extra lab, separate from the
lab you already did this afternoon; it goes deeper on the same formula.

This is not "measure one model on one GPU." This is "solve, on paper first,
which of five real models fits a budget you're given" -- the question a
platform engineer actually gets asked before any GPU is touched.

## Predict

Credited for handing it in, never marked right or wrong - hedged guesses teach nothing, and nothing here is graded for accuracy.

Fill this in before you write any code.

- A model's `config.json` never states its total parameter count directly.
  Which fields would you need to derive it? Name at least four. #hidden_size  num_hidden_layers  intermediate_size  vocan_size
- Two models are both called "3B" by their filenames. Would you expect their
  computed parameter counts to match exactly? Why or why not? #No because they might contain different values in the config.json file 
- If you assume a model does NOT tie its input and output embeddings, but it
  actually does, will your computed parameter count read high or low? # -tied embeddings: 10000*100 = 1000000 (million parameters) for an embedding matrix (inpu and output embeddings). -not tied: each one of the embedding (input and output) have one million parameters = 1 million+ 1 million = 2 millions because they're independent. I the model doesn't tie the input/output embeddings it goes higher (2million > 1 million)
- Hand in the card.

## The delta

### Step 1: the catalog (given, about 5 min to read)

You are given five real models' architecture fields below -- the same fields
that live in every Hugging Face `config.json`. This is a small local catalog so
the lab runs with no network dependency; Stretch below covers pulling the real
file for a model of your choice.

```python
CATALOG = {
    "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct": {"hidden_size": 896, "num_hidden_layers": 24, "num_attention_heads": 14, "num_key_value_heads": 2, "intermediate_size": 4864, "vocab_size": 151936, "tie_word_embeddings": True},
    "Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct": {"hidden_size": 1536, "num_hidden_layers": 28, "num_attention_heads": 12, "num_key_value_heads": 2, "intermediate_size": 8960, "vocab_size": 151936, "tie_word_embeddings": True},
    "Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct": {"hidden_size": 2048, "num_hidden_layers": 36, "num_attention_heads": 16, "num_key_value_heads": 2, "intermediate_size": 11008, "vocab_size": 151936, "tie_word_embeddings": True},
    "Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct": {"hidden_size": 2048, "num_hidden_layers": 16, "num_attention_heads": 32, "num_key_value_heads": 8, "intermediate_size": 8192, "vocab_size": 128256, "tie_word_embeddings": True},
    "Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct": {"hidden_size": 3072, "num_hidden_layers": 28, "num_attention_heads": 24, "num_key_value_heads": 8, "intermediate_size": 8192, "vocab_size": 128256, "tie_word_embeddings": True},
}
```

These fields are reconstructed from each model's real published config, not a
live download -- close enough that the derived parameter counts below match
each model's real published size almost exactly, which you will check in
Step 2.

### Step 2: derive the parameter count (about 30 min, this is the lab)

A standard Llama/Qwen-style transformer block has four attention projections
and a three-matrix gated MLP. Nothing here is given as a number; every count
below comes from multiplying two dimensions together.

```python
def count_params(cfg):
    h = cfg["hidden_size"]
    L = cfg["num_hidden_layers"]
    n_heads = cfg["num_attention_heads"]
    n_kv = cfg["num_key_value_heads"]
    inter = cfg["intermediate_size"]
    vocab = cfg["vocab_size"]
    tied = cfg.get("tie_word_embeddings", False)
    head_dim = h // n_heads

    # attention: q and o are full hidden_size x hidden_size; k and v are
    # narrower because of grouped-query attention (fewer kv heads than query heads)
    q = h * h
    k = h * (n_kv * head_dim)
    v = h * (n_kv * head_dim)
    o = h * h
    attn = q + k + v + o

    # gated MLP (SwiGLU-style): three matrices, not two
    gate = h * inter
    up = h * inter
    down = inter * h
    mlp = gate + up + down

    per_layer = attn + mlp
    embed_matrices = 1 if tied else 2   # tied models reuse one matrix for input+output
    total = L * per_layer + embed_matrices * vocab * h
    return total


for name, cfg in CATALOG.items():
    p = count_params(cfg)
    print(f"{name}: {p/1e9:.2f}B params")
```

Run it. Compare each result to the number in the model's own name. They should
land within a rounding error of each other -- 1.5B computes to about 1.54B, 3B
computes to about 3.09-3.21B. If yours are close, your formula is right.

**Now the gotcha, on purpose:** flip `tie_word_embeddings` to `False` for
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and rerun just that one model. You should see about
1.78B instead of 1.54B -- a 15% overestimate. This is not an error in your
formula; it is exactly what happens when a model ties its input and output
embedding matrices to save parameters and your code assumes it doesn't. Real
`config.json` files state `tie_word_embeddings` explicitly; this is why you
read it instead of guessing.

### Step 3: KV cost per token (about 10 min -- this formula is not new)

You already have this from earlier in the week: 2 (K and V) times layers times
kv-heads times head-dim times bytes-per-element.

```python
def kv_bytes_per_token(cfg, kv_dtype_bytes=2):
    h = cfg["hidden_size"]
    L = cfg["num_hidden_layers"]
    n_kv = cfg["num_key_value_heads"]
    n_heads = cfg["num_attention_heads"]
    head_dim = h // n_heads
    return 2 * L * n_kv * head_dim * kv_dtype_bytes
```

Simplifying assumption, stated up front: the KV cache is assumed fp16
regardless of what precision the weights are quantised to. Real serving stacks
sometimes quantise KV too; that is out of scope here.

### Step 4: solve the budget (about 25 min)

Given a budget, concurrent-user count, and context length, compute total GB for
every model at every precision, and pick the largest model that still fits.

```python
PRECISIONS = {"fp16": 2.0, "int8": 1.0, "int4": 0.5}
OVERHEAD_GB = 1.5   # fixed CUDA/allocator overhead, midpoint of W2D1's 1-2 GB range

def solve(budget_gb, concurrent_users, context_tokens):
    rows = []
    for name, cfg in CATALOG.items():
        params = count_params(cfg)
        kv_per_tok = kv_bytes_per_token(cfg)
        for prec, bytes_per_param in PRECISIONS.items():
            weight_gb = params * bytes_per_param / 1e9
            kv_gb = kv_per_tok * context_tokens * concurrent_users / 1e9
            total_gb = weight_gb + kv_gb + OVERHEAD_GB
            fits = total_gb <= budget_gb
            rows.append({
                "model": name, "precision": prec, "params": params,
                "weight_gb": round(weight_gb, 2), "kv_gb": round(kv_gb, 2),
                "total_gb": round(total_gb, 2), "fits": fits,
            })
    fitting = [r for r in rows if r["fits"]]
    best = max(fitting, key=lambda r: r["params"]) if fitting else None
    return rows, best

rows, best = solve(budget_gb=16, concurrent_users=4, context_tokens=4096)
for r in sorted(rows, key=lambda r: -r["params"]):
    mark = "FITS" if r["fits"] else "----"
    print(f"{mark}  {r['model']:25s} {r['precision']:5s}  total={r['total_gb']:6.2f}GB")
print("BEST:", best)
```

`best` should be the largest-parameter combination whose `total_gb` does not
exceed the budget. If no combination fits, `best` is `None` -- handle that case,
do not crash on it.

### Step 5: write budget_solution.json

```python
import json
budget_gb, concurrent_users, context_tokens = 16, 4, 4096
rows, best = solve(budget_gb, concurrent_users, context_tokens)
out = {
    "budget_gb": budget_gb, "concurrent_users": concurrent_users,
    "context_tokens": context_tokens, "best": best,
    "all_combinations": rows,
}
with open("budget_solution.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(out, f, indent=2)
print(json.dumps(best, indent=2))
```

## Verify (green check)

Run the verifier next to your `budget_solution.json` (or paste it into a cell):

```bash
python verify.py
```

It recomputes every combination from the same catalog independently and checks
your numbers against it, so a solver that is consistently wrong cannot pass by
being consistent. Expected final line: `GREEN CHECK: PASS`.

## Stretch

Swap the local `CATALOG` for a real download: use `huggingface_hub`'s
`hf_hub_download` to pull the actual `config.json` for a model of your choice,
parse the same fields out of it, and confirm your formula's output against the
model card's stated parameter count. This is the same computation, against a
file you did not get handed.

## Failure modes

- **Computed params are about 15-20% too high.** Cause: `tie_word_embeddings`
  was read as `False` (or defaulted) for a model that actually ties its
  embeddings. Fix: check the field is actually present and read correctly in
  your catalog entry -- this is the Step 2 gotcha, not a bug in the formula.
- **`best` is always `None`.** Cause: budget is genuinely too small for any
  catalog entry, or `OVERHEAD_GB` and KV cost are being double-counted somewhere.
  Fix: print every row's `total_gb` and sanity-check the smallest one by hand.
- **KV cost dwarfs everything else and nothing fits at high concurrency.**
  This is expected at large `concurrent_users x context_tokens` products, not a
  bug -- it is the same lesson as the KV-cache section of this week's lecture,
  just applied to many users instead of one.
- **head_dim comes out as a non-integer.** Cause: `hidden_size` is not evenly
  divisible by `num_attention_heads` in a catalog entry you edited or added.
  Fix: real models always divide evenly; check the entry against the model's
  actual config rather than adjusting the formula.
